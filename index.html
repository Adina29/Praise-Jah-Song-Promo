  <h1>Praise Jah in the Moonlight</h1>
  <h2>YG Marley</h2>
  <h3> What is 'Praise Jah In The Moonlight' about ?
    <p>"Praise Jah in the Moonlight" is a heartfelt song from YG Marley about faith and self-discovery.
        We can learn to maintain our faith, even during tough times as artist highlights in his lyrics ("Give Jah all the thanks and praises").
        Remember that it's okay to love deeply. Rejection does not diminish your worth: "showed you I loved you; you called me a liar."
        You're never alone, reach out when feeling lonely. Communication enhances interconnectedness among us despite apparent isolation.
        Lastly, this song teaches us that everyone has intrinsic value beyond material measures. Respect yourself and others along these lines - “it’s worth more than gold”.</li>
    </p>

    <p>And when you're feeling alone</p>
    <p>You can call my phone</p>
    <p>You can call my phone</p>
    <p>Is there a better way to go?</p>
    <p>Teach them something before they lose their soul</p>
    <p>Oh, no, no, no freedom is the road</p>
    <p>Oh, no, no, no coming in from the cold</p>
    <p>Tell them not to sell it, it's worth more than gold</p>
    <p>And guiltiness will catch them in the end</p>
    <p>Oh yeah, oh yeah</p>
    <p>They'll try to manipulate you through your pockets (ahh)</p>
    <p>Now you're caught up in a funk with the optic, with the vision (ahh)</p>
    <p>Trying to control your soul and take control</p>
    <p>Oh, no, no, no (ahh)</p>
    <p>No, we don't play that game right here to win power (ahh)</p>
